## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an Unreal Engine coursework assignment at Humber Polytechnic. It focuses on implementing gameplay systems using Unreal Engine and C++, with an emphasis on modular design, Blueprint integration, and gameplay logic.

The core feature of the project is a **skill tree system** combined with a **light roguelike mechanic**. Instead of selecting skills from a static tree, the player is periodically presented with **three randomly selected skills drawn from a predefined pool**, encouraging replayability and strategic decision making.
